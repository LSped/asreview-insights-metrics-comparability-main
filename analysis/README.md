## Postprocessing


To provide a preliminary analysis of the difference in WSS95% and TNR95% scores across datasets. A default simulation (TF-IDF + NB) was run on 24 datasets of the synergy dataset. (Note: Brouwer_2019 and Walker_2018 are excluded due to their high computation time)

See Jupyter Notebook.
